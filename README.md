##Built with GitHub Copilot
This project was developed in close collaboration with GitHub Copilot, which served as a creative and technical companion throughout the build. From debugging Python logic to refining CLI workflows, Copilot helped shape the tool‚Äôs structure, banner rotation, and DNSSEC validation logic ‚Äî turning raw ideas into a polished, demo-ready solution.

‚ÄúCopilot wasn‚Äôt just a code assistant ‚Äî it was a thinking partner. Every banner, every validation rule, every visual element was sharpened through that collaboration.‚Äù ‚Äî Angole Sharif Abubakar


##üåç Vision & Impact
This tool is part of a broader mission to:

Strengthen DNSSEC adoption across African ccTLDs

Make cybersecurity accessible through visual storytelling

Empower registries, developers, and communities with open-source tools
